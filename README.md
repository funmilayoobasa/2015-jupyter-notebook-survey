# 2015 Jupyter Notebook Survey

Jupyter Notebook is a flexible web app that allows you to compute data, write various programming languages, plain text, equations, markdown, etc. For my first data analysis project, I explored the responses from a 2015 Jupyter Notebook survey organised by Project Jupyter. You will find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/2015-notebook-ux-survey).

This is not perfect. It isn't even remotely close to perfect, but the process was worthwhile. I will appreciate your feedback.
