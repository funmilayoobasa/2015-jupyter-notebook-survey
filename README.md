# 2015-jupyter-notebook-survey

Jupyter Notebook is a flexible web app that allows you to compute data.

For my first unguided data analysis project, I explored the responses from a 2015 Jupyter Notebook survey. 

This is the data set I used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/2015-notebook-ux-survey. 

This is not perfect. It isn't even remotely close to perfect, but the process was worthwhile. I will appreciate any form of feedback you have to give.
